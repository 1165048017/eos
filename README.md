eos is a lightweight 3D Morphable Face Model fitting library that provides just the bare minimum to load a model and perform camera and shape fitting. It's written in modern C++11/14.

At the moment, it mainly provides the following functionality:

* MorphableModel class to represent a 3DMM (using OpenCVs `cv::Mat`)
* Our low-resolution, shape-only 3D Morphable Face Model ([share/sfm_shape_3448.bin](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/share/sfm_shape_3448.bin))
* Camera pose estimation, implementation of:
  * the _Gold Standard Algorithm_ for estimating an affine camera matrix, from Multiple View Geometry, Hartley & Zisserman
  * a non-linear algorithm that directly estimates the pose angles and camera translation
* Shape fitting, implementation of the linear shape-to-landmarks fitting of O. Aldrian & W. Smith, _Inverse Rendering of Faces with a 3D Morphable Model_, PAMI 2013
* Expression fitting, and 6 linear expression blendshapes: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise.
* Isomap texture extraction to obtain a pose-invariant representation of the face texture.

## Usage

* Tested with the following compilers: >=gcc-4.8.4, >=clang-3.5, Visual Studio 2015
* Needed dependencies for the library: Boost system (>=1.50.0), OpenCV core (>=2.4.3)

To use the library in your own project, just add the following directories to your include path:

* `eos/include`
* `eos/3rdparty/cereal-1.1.1/include`
* `eos/3rdparty/glm-0.9.7.0`

### Build the examples and tests

* Needed dependencies for the example app: CMake (>=2.8.10), Boost system, filesystem, program_options (>=1.50.0), OpenCV core, imgproc, highgui (>=2.4.3).

To build:

```
git clone https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos.git
mkdir build && cd build # creates a build directory next to the _eos_ folder
cmake -G "<your favourite generator>" ../eos -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install/`
make && make install # or open the project file and build in an IDE like Visual Studio
```
If some dependencies can't be found, copy `initial_cache.cmake.template` to `initial_cache.cmake`, edit the necessary paths and run `cmake` with `-C ../eos/initial_cache.cmake`.


## Sample code

The fit-model example app creates a 3D face from a 2D image.

After `make install` or running the `INSTALL` target, an example image with landmarks can be found in `install/bin/data/`. The model and the necessary landmarks mapping file are installed to `install/share/`.

You can run the example just by running:

`fit-model`

Or, by manually specifying the face model, landmark-to-vertex mappings, an image and its 2D landmarks:

`fit-model -m ../share/sfm_shape_3448.bin -p ../share/ibug2did.txt -i data/image_0010.png -l data/image_0010.pts`

The output is an `obj` file with the shape and a `png` with the extracted isomap. The estimated pose angles and shape coefficients are available in the code via the API.

See [examples/fit-model.cpp](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/examples/fit-model.cpp) for the full code.

## The Surrey Face Model

The library includes a low-resolution shape-only version of the Surrey Morphable Face Model. It is a PCA model of shape variation built from 3D face scans. It comes with uv-coordinates to perform texture remapping.

The full model will be available soon too via academic licencing.

## Documentation

Doxygen: http://patrikhuber.github.io/eos/doc/

The [fit-model example](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/examples/fit-model.cpp) and the [Namespace List](http://patrikhuber.github.io/eos/doc/namespaces.html) in doxygen are a good place to start.
