It's written in modern C++11/14.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it mainly provides the following functionality:\r\n\r\n* MorphableModel class to represent a 3DMM (using OpenCVs `cv::Mat`)\r\n* Camera pose estimation, implementation of:\r\n  * the _Gold Standard Algorithm_ for estimating an affine camera matrix, from Multiple View Geometry, Hartley & Zisserman\r\n  * a non-linear algorithm that directly estimates the pose angles and camera translation\r\n* Shape fitting, implementation of the linear shape-to-landmarks fitting of O. Aldrian & W. Smith, _Inverse Rendering of Faces with a 3D Morphable Model_, PAMI 2013\r\n* Isomap texture extraction to obtain a pose-invariant representation of the face texture.\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/patrikhuber/superviseddescent\" aria-hidden=\"true\">More information, features and sample code on Github</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"doc/index.html\" aria-hidden=\"true\">Documentation (doxygen)</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>License & contributions:</h3>\r\n\r\nThis code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0\r\n\r\nContributions are very welcome!
